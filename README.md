Project Title: My LinkedIn Profile QR Code Generator
Description: A Python-based QR code generation tool that creates a scannable QR code linking directly to my LinkedIn profile. This project showcases my proficiency in Python automation, image processing, and practical application development.

Features:
    • Generates high-quality QR codes
    • Customizable design options (color, size, border)
    • Saves output as PNG image

Tech Stack: Python, qrcode library, Pillow (PIL)

How It Works: The script takes a LinkedIn URL as input, processes it through the QR code algorithm, and outputs a scannable image that redirects to the profile when scanned with anyone's smartphone camera.
